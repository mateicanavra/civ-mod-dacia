            <Text>The Dacians had a centralized kingdom in the 1st century BCE under King Burebista, who led successful military campaigns and created a powerful state. The kingdom reached its peak under King Decebalus (87-106 CE), when its territory stretched from the Black Sea to the Tisza River and from the Balkan Mountains to the Carpathian Mountains.</Text>
