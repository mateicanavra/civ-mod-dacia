# Dacia Civilization Overview

## Historical Background

The Dacians were a Thracian people who inhabited the regions of modern Romania and Moldova, as well as parts of Ukraine, Eastern Serbia, Northern Bulgaria, Slovakia, Hungary, and Southern Poland. They built a powerful kingdom in the Carpathian Mountains and its surroundings, reaching their peak during the 1st century BCE through the early 2nd century CE. Known for their impressive gold mines, distinctive curved blades (falxes), and formidable hill fortresses, they represented one of Rome's most challenging opponents on its northeastern frontier.

The Dacian religion centered around Zalmoxis, a deity believed to offer immortality, with rituals performed in distinctive mountain sanctuaries. Their society combined tribal organization with centralized authority under kings, allowing them to field powerful armies while developing sophisticated metalworking and architectural techniques.

## Dacia - Burebista

### Flavor Text
*"Unite under one banner, and we shall create an empire that rivals even Rome itself. Our mountains hold gold, our people possess courage, and our gods grant wisdom."*

### Historical Context
Burebista (82-44 BCE) was the first king to unite the Dacian tribes into a formidable kingdom. Through military campaigns and political acumen, he expanded Dacian territory from the Northern Carpathians to the Black Sea and from the Danube to modern Ukraine. Burebista implemented sweeping social reforms, including strict moral codes and a ban on vineyard cultivation to strengthen his people. Under his leadership, Dacia became a centralized state that commanded respect even from Rome, which considered launching a campaign against him before Julius Caesar's assassination disrupted these plans.

### Flavor Text
*"Our mountains are our fortresses, our weapons are our pride, and our spirit is unbreakable. Let Rome send its legionsâ€”they will find only defeat in our lands."*

### Historical Context
Decebalus (r. 87-106 CE) was the last king of Dacia and its most brilliant military leader. Rising to power during a time of conflict with Rome, he reorganized the Dacian army, strengthened defenses, and improved military technology by hiring Roman craftsmen. Under his leadership, Dacia initially defeated Emperor Domitian's forces, securing a favorable peace treaty. However, later wars against Emperor Trajan's massive campaigns ultimately led to Dacia's conquest in 106 CE. Rather than face capture, Decebalus committed suicide, becoming a symbol of fierce resistance against imperial conquest.
