# Military Strategies for the Dacian CIV

### Hit & Run
Conquer a settlement to acquire forward settled friendly territory. Dacia under Burebista grants units in that settlement (now friendly territory) 100% faster recovery if it has a temple of Zalmoxis. If a settlement has an Altar, it must be overbuilt with the Temple of Zalmoxis.


## Power Punches (Superior Dacian Abilities and Bonuses)

### The Dark Forest
+1 combat strength, +1 movement, and +1 sight on forest tiles. Navigable river tiles between two forest tiles don't require embarkation.

### The Hills Have Eyes
+5 combat strength, +1 movement, and +1 sight on rough terrain. Gain influence equal to 50% of unit's HP after destroying an enemy unit.

### The Rest of Us
+100% influence toward becoming suzerein of a hostile city-state. +100% influence toward rejecting diplomatic actions from civs with a larger military. +5 combat strength against city-states.

# Other thoughts
### Interactive Modifiers
Modifiers that are applied only after a specific in-game interaction, like creating a settlement, conquering a settlement, befriending a city-state, etc.

CIV 7 already has some of these, but they are not prominently leveraged as part of the civ/leader mechanics. Usually, they're provided

Civilization Card: **King Burebista of Dacia**
----------------------------------------------

*King Burebista (82--44 BC) was the first unifier of the Dacian tribes, forging a powerful kingdom with common laws and religion‚Äã*

*[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360052275_BUREBISTA_THE_DEFENDER_AND_UNIFIER_OF_THE_DACIANS#:~:text=Burebista%20was%20the%20founder%20of,model%20of%20European%20leader%2C%20being)*

*. Renowned as an astute statesman and conqueror, he expanded Dacia's borders from the Carpathians to the Black Sea, even impressing Greek contemporaries as "the greatest of all Thracians"‚Äã

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacians#:~:text=The%20Dacian%20kingdom%20reached%20its,Burebista%20annexed%20the%20Greek%20cities)

.*

-   **CIV Ability -- Murus Dacicus:** *"Dacian Wall" fortifications encircle every settlement.* All **cities gain +3 City Defense Strength** off the bat. **Walls and other defensive structures are built 30% faster**, and each completed wall level provides **+2 üõ†Ô∏è Production** in that city (reflecting Dacia's famed layered stone-and-timber ramparts). This makes Dacian cities tougher nuts to crack and economically rewarded for strong defenses.
-   **Leader Ability -- Unifier of the Tribes:** *Burebista's rule knit disparate tribes into one realm.* **Capturing a city immediately grants a lump sum of üïäÔ∏è Influence** (facilitating further diplomacy or expansion) and **improves Dacia's relations with City-States**. Diplomatic actions with City-States cost 50% less Influence for Dacia under Burebista, reflecting his talent for bringing allies or vassals into the fold. (E.g. securing treaties, levying troops, or integrating independent cities is cheaper and easier.)
-   **Unique Unit -- Falxman:** *Dacian heavy infantry wielding the deadly two-handed falx blade.* This **Classical-era melee unit** replaces the standard swordsman. It boasts **+5 üó°Ô∏è Combat Strength when attacking**, and **deals bonus damage vs. fortified units or district defenses** (its curved blade was historically capable of cleaving through Roman helmets‚Äã

    [livius.org](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/dacia/roman-dacia/#:~:text=That%20the%20Dacians%20were%20a,braces%20in%20a%20cross%20shape)

    ). The Falxman forgoes a shield, so it has slightly lower defense when besieged by ranged attacks, but its aggressive power can overwhelm fortified enemies. (Requires Iron; upgrades from Warriors and into later Gunpowder units.)
-   **Unique Infrastructure -- Temple of Zalmoxis:** *A high sanctuary devoted to the Dacians' supreme deity, Zalmoxis.* This **unique Temple building** (in the Worship quarter) spreads spiritual unity. It provides **+6 üòä Happiness** (higher than a regular Temple's 4) and **contains a Relic slot**. Additionally, **units trained in or garrisoned in a city with the Temple of Zalmoxis heal at double the normal rate** within that city's territory. Dacian cities with this temple become bastions of fervor where warriors recover quickly, mirroring Burebista's use of religion to strengthen his people‚Äã

Civilization Card: **King Decebalus of Dacia**
----------------------------------------------

![https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Decebalus_Mountain_Engraving.jpg](blob:https://chatgpt.com/76e41eee-be85-4601-9639-5ad5a152ec27)

*King Decebalus (c. 87--106 AD) was the last king of independent Dacia, celebrated for his fierce guerrilla resistance against Rome. From his mountain strongholds, he led a defensive war that confounded emperors Domitian and Trajan. Dacian warriors under Decebalus were said to fight fearlessly, believing "in their hearts they do not die, but only change their place"‚Äã*

*[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/w0iszv/civ_vi_suggestion_decebalus_dacia/#:~:text=feared%20warriors%2C%20because%20they%20were,look%20at%20this%20Trajan%20quote)*

*, making them resolute even in the face of defeat.*

-   **CIV Ability -- Murus Dacicus:** *The same civilization ability as described above is shared by Decebalus's Dacia.* Dacian cities enjoy superior defenses and productivity from fortifications (increased city defense strength, faster wall construction, and bonus production from walls). These robust **"Murus Dacicus"** fortifications proved their worth during Decebalus's campaigns, forcing the Romans to commit massive resources to breach Dacia's hillforts.
-   **Leader Ability -- One with the Wolves:** *Decebalus was a master of guerrilla tactics and drew on the "wolf" spirit of the Dacians (the very name "Dacian" likely meant "wolf").* **All Dacian units under Decebalus gain +5 üó°Ô∏è Combat Strength when fighting on Hills or in Forest terrain.** They also ignore movement penalties in those terrains, allowing for swift hit-and-run strikes. Additionally, **when a Dacian unit is killed in combat, Dacia gains a small amount of üïäÔ∏è Influence and the enemy earns 50% less XP from that loss**. This reflects the Dacian ethos of *"death before dishonor"* -- their warriors' sacrifices inspire the nation rather than the foe. (These bonuses make Decebalus's forces excel at home-turf defense and raiding tactics, leveraging Dacia's rugged landscape.)
-   **Unique Unit -- Falxman:** *Dacia's signature falx-wielding infantry is available to Decebalus as well.* The **Falxman** retains its high offensive strength and anti-fortification role, which perfectly suits Decebalus's tactics of ambushing Roman columns and smashing through their shield walls. (See Burebista's section above for full unit details.) Decebalus's Falxmen were so formidable that Trajan had to reinforce his legionnaires' armor‚Äã

    [livius.org](https://www.livius.org/articles/place/dacia/roman-dacia/#:~:text=That%20the%20Dacians%20were%20a,braces%20in%20a%20cross%20shape)

    -- in game, they will similarly force enemies to think twice before engaging head-on.
-   **Unique Infrastructure -- Temple of Zalmoxis:** *Decebalus's Dacia also has access to the unique Temple of Zalmoxis.* The spiritual unity it provides (extra Happiness and faster healing in its cities) bolsters Dacian morale in defense. This unique temple's healing aura synergizes with Decebalus's need to recover quickly between skirmishes, embodying the zealous faith that every fallen Dacian's soul lives on. (See Burebista's section for details on this unique building's effects.)
